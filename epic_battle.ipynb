While apparently a very popular tradition, I'm not sure it's really good for anything today.

    "Many programming books I have read are very thorough. They want to make sure they tell you every single thing that you might possibly need to know to use every single expression, statement, and function they introduce. This style of writing has produced some very, very useful books. However, this style was developed during a time when it was really hard to find information about things, so being thoroughly thorough was thoroughly awesome. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if an author introduced you to a data structure known as a **`list`** and didn't tell you that it came ready-built with a method called **`list.sort()`**, it's very likely you wouldn't learn about **`list.sort()`** unless and until you stopped reading, left home, went to the library or bookstore, and found yourself another book with that information. \n",
    "\n",
    "So it was very, very nice if the author decided to put the information about **`sort`** right there in the section about **`list`**, so that you would see it once when you learned about this amazing data structure, and then you could easily (in the pre-internet sense of \"easily\") see it again if you went back and referred to the **`list`** section later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*But when the internet came along, the definitions of \"hard\" and \"easy\" changed.*\n",

    "If I am reading a book that has a section about lists, it is no longer difficult to find a vast amount of reference material instantly, without even leaving my chair. Now it may still be useful to have a book that is very thorough. But it is no longer quite as necessary as it once was, which suggests some new possibilities for authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility is that an author could write in a way that flows more quickly to some very interesting places, and if the reader gets a little bit lost at some point along the way, she can **easily** re-orient herself with a quick, well-targeted Google search. One might even introduce some very advanced concepts early, for the time being explaining only what they do, and leaving more detailed discussion for later. Thus, a non-beginner will be less bored, and again, the curious beginner can get her Google on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I am going to try to re-prioritize. The hope is that a beginner will find this tutorial accessible, but do expect it to flow more quickly than other beginning tutorials. As new concepts are introduced, the aim is to provide terms that will help you search readily if you need or want more detail. But I'm not going to sacrifice flow for completeness, because the optimal balance between these two isn't the same as it was  before the internet. Maybe I'll get it wrong, but the potential gain is worth the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, which should take no more than an hour or two to complete (and much less if you are a non-beginner), you will have been exposed to concepts that might take up as much as a few weeks in an introductory undergraduate programming course, as well as a few advanced concepts. There will be a lot of useful details that you will not know about without some extra effort. But I believe in you. The Googling force is strong in you. And I will not leave you hanging.

    "While we are on the subject of exploring, it is useful to mention that IPython supports a workflow known as **execute-and-explore.** (Thank you for point this out, [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/edinburgh-data-science/introduction-data-analysis).)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with a programming language that uses an **edit-compile-run** workflow. In case you aren't, this means that you write some *instructions* (the instructions are called *code*) in a text document (this is the *edit* step), give the document to a special program called a compiler (the *compile* step), which then gives you a file known as an *executable.* Then you run the executable (which, you will be shocked to learn, is known as the *run* step), and voila! Your program does its thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two salient examples of languages that use the **edit-compile-run** workflow are **Java** and **C++**.  They are quite powerful, and have historically been the workhorses of professional programmers. If you are a professional programmer, you are writing code many hours everyday, and the **edit-compile-run** workflow is not a problem. It may even offer some advantages above and beyond the intrinsic power of the languages themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you only write code for a few hours every week, or once every few months--as do many scientists, engineers, hobbyists, and other assorted non-programmer flavors of nerd--the **edit-compile-run** workflow can be a bit of a problem. Why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a one-word answer: **syntax.** To unpack, the code written in the **edit** step must be written according to a very strict set of rules, the *syntax* of the programming language. Every programming language has a strict syntax, without which the computer would never figure out exactly what you want it to do. So why is this fact of syntax more of an issue for **edit-compile-run** than for **execute-and-explore**? "

If you are a professional programmer, you will quickly learn how to get on the compiler's good side, and your text documents will have few syntax errors. The compiler will still catch everyone you make, but you will be able to correct them quickly and then the compiler will give you your executable. You and the compiler will soon be best friends. Lots of happy.\n",

On the bright side, if you are possessed of good self-control, you might successfully refrain from inflicting severe physical damage (aka *trauma*) on your computer hardware. So there's that.

    "The worst teacher in the world never really does any teaching, she just expects you to show up and turn your paper in. Then you have to sit there for a long time and listen to him talk and talk without interrupting (it's called a lecture). Then you have to go home and wait for her to grade your paper. This is where the real nightmare begins. As soon as he finds a mistake, she circles it, adding annotations of angry red crossings out and exclamation marks, stops grading it, writes a big red 'F' on the title page, and hands it back, explaining that he refuses to grade the rest of your paper until you correct that mistake. Her lectures supposedly contain feedback that supposedly contains information that will supposedly help you fix the problem, but his supposed people skills are horrible, and the supposed feedback she gives is really not anything that can be understood by *normal* people. Then you fix that mistake (which may take you more than one try), only to have him throw the same tantrum over your next mistake. Thinking nasty thoughts yet?\n",

If asked nicely, they will usually be glad to explain what the compiler's cryptic feedback means. But some of them love the compiler, so try having a little tolerance.\n",

She never sends you away to another program, although he doesn't mind if you go and come back. You don't have to give her a whole long bunch of code at once (though again, you can if you want), you can just give him one or two sentences. It's true that she is very picky like the compiler, and will stop you if you made a syntax error, but he is much easier to talk to. If you don't understand her explanation of the error, he has a number of ways to help you with that. She will wait patiently while you try to correct the error, instead of sending you away to an editor. And if you give him a correct sentence, instead of giving you an executable that you have to go away and execute someplace else, she will execute it for you, right there on the spot. So you get immediate feedback for any syntax errors that you make, and immediate execution the errors are taken care of.\n",

At any point, if you can't remember how to do something, you can ask him for help. She doesn't know everything, and you may have to go somewhere else to find some things out, but he is pretty darn helpful, especially compared to Mr. and/or Ms. Cold-as-crap compiler.\n",

    "12. The [**function**](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+function)  \n",
    "A **function** is an expression that takes zero or more arguments and returns a value stored in some kind of data structure. In this code, we see Python's **built-in** **range()** **function,** which, in its simplest form, takes an integer (a data structure of type 'int') and returns a list with integers from zero up to, but not including, that integer. Another useful **built-in** is **type()**, which returns the type of its argument.\n",

    "The links above link to Google searches. Explore them at your leisure. Why did I do this when you could just go to Google and type the search yourself? Because you might not. You might not click on the links either, but you're more likely to click in one step than open a new tab, go to Google, type \"python data structures\", and hit enter, which is four steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do follow the links, just spend a very little time on each one, a couple of minutes at most. The idea is to try and see the two or three things that stand out the most and then remember them. If you do that, each time you come back again and search, you will build on that foundation, and you will remember more and more each time. And in this way, your powers will become very great, young Padawan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point I'm trying to make is two-fold. First, if you get used to googling almost everything, you will find out just how much is out there, and you will get better and better at finding it quickly. You will also get to know certain websites as being particularly useful--for instance, two of my favorites are [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/2.7/) and [ and [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/). Second, from here on, every time I put a word in **bold-face** type, I am letting you know that if you put \"python\" plus that term in a Google search, it will probably be worth your while. I'm not going to keep linking everything to Google, though, because I am hoping that after seeing how valuable and easy it is to use Google in this way, you will be willing to do the three extra steps yourself.\n",

Mighty. OK, I did it again after all. But that's because Python **keywords** and **operators** are [**Monty**](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+keywords) important."
