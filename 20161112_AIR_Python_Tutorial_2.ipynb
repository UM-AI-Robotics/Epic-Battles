Epic Arena has a well-trained, well-staffed blown brain cleanup crew (BBCC). If you are squeamish, just close your eyes and think happy thoughts while the BBCC gets it done. Your brain, somebody else's, what does it matter, as long as they pack it back nice and good as new?\n",

After that, we will start adding new behavior, which will make the program even more awesome. More awesome how? Well, there are many ways to improve it, but for today we are going to emphasize techniques that give the **user** and the **developer** better **control** over the input and the output. \n",

    "* Announce the matches one by one  \n",

    "* We represented the heroes and the villains using strings in a `list`  \n",
    "* We used a `for` loop to iterate over the lists and `print` each announcement to the screen  \n",

A hint is that the examples in this section are mostly about the **coding style,** while the examples in the next section are about adding new **behaviors**. At the end of the lesson, we'll come back and take stock of these ideas again."

    "**HERE IS A WORD.** A word about online resources for Python: Python 3 has been out since 2008, but Python 2 is still being widely used. And we are using Python 2. Why?? Isn't 3 better than 2? Or is something wrong with Python 3? \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To get complete answers to questions of the Python 2 vs Python 3 ilk, you are going to need to do some of your own research online.  The short answer as to why we are using Python 2 is 1) A significant minority of Python users and developers were not happy with the changes in Python 3. In their view, nothing is wrong with Python 2 and it didn't need fixing. So there are significant libraries that are being developed in Python 2 to this day, and some of these libraries are great for AI and robotics. 2) GvR and his friends have promised to support Python 2.7.12 until 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, Python 3 has a lot of cool features and I am not in the camp of those who don't like it. However, many times, when there are two choices A & B, it can be easier to learn A then B than it is to learn B then A. Examples of this are acoustic vs electric guitars, stick shifts vs automatic transmissions, and manual vs electric typewriters **(What the heck is a TYPEWRITER??!! Only old people and Google can tell you. Or maybe a museum.)**  In my opinion, this is also true of Python 2 vs Python 3. So my advice for general programming education is to learn Python 2 first and then learn Python 3 on your own--you can even set up your computer to have independent environments so that you can play with, build with, and learn both. This way you are going to have maximum options when it comes to using other peoples' code, and you will have better knowledge about how to adapt their code to fit your needs."

I realize that this could take us out of one type of quicksand and get us bogged down with another. But there is a way to stay out of the quicksand: 1) Google stuff! 2) Use the IPython tricks learned in last week's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-rcGV35n9w)! Some people may still fall into quicksand, but I am hoping that at least some of you will learn how not to, and then you'll be able to help me get the others out. If this doesn't work, and everyone falls in, then I'll use a different approach. But if this approach works, we can move a lot more quickly. So I think it is worth the risk to try it."

GvR estimated that programmers spend about 80% of their time **reading** rather than **writing** code, so syntax that improves readability can have a huge payoff. **Pythonic** code uses **syntactic sugar** and other **idioms**, clever conventions for variable names, and a few other strategies to make well-written Python code read almost like plain English. \n",

    "* **`bool`, the Boolean type.** Python has two built-in objects, `True` and `False` that are used as values for conditional tests. \n",
    "* **`if` statement.** `if` begins a **control flow statement** that contains a conditional expression, and if that expression evaluates to `True`, the code block beneath the `if` statement is executed. There are other topics to be covered when learning about `if` statements, such as **`else`** and **`elif`** statements--if you want to know what these do right now, you know what to do. Either way, we'll come back to these later. \n",
    "* **`while` statement.** Another **control flow statement** that loops over a code block as long as its conditional expression evaluates to `True`. \n",
    "* **Indentation.** We haven't discussed indentation yet, but it's a big and important topic. Briefly, Python uses indentation to delineate code blocks. If you are coming from another programming language, it will perhaps seem odd that **white space at the beginning of a line of code is syntactically important.** What does that mean? Well for starters, it means that if you do not indent properly, you will probably get errors. Secondly, it means that when you write code meant to be in the body of a `for` loop, `if` statement, or `while` statement, that code needs to be in an indented block below the `for`, `if` or `while` line. **Notice also that you must end these statements with a colon** and then start the indented code block on the next line. There are **rules** and **suggestions** about indentation--we'll say more later.\n",
    "* **New methods.** We've introduced several new methods in this code example, one for `list` objects, and two for strings. Please check them out with your own there-is-no-spoon."

    "OK. I'll admit, that's kind of a lot to throw at you, but you've gotten this far, which proves you are made of hardy stuff. No run-of-the-mill budding Pythonista are you. You are **not** going to let this beat you. So **get a grip!!** Here's a summary of what's changed from **Code Example 2-3:**\n",
    "* **`with` statements.** A `with` statement introduces something called a **context manager.** This is an advanced topic, and if you want to dive in, a good intro is found [here](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/). But for now, it's enough to think of this as a standard way to get stuff from a file. There are subtleties upon subtleties, but we are going to dodge them for now.\n",
    "* **`open()` and `file` objects.** The Python's built-in `open()` method returns a `file` object. We are calling `open()` using the **default mode**, and using a single method of the `file` object class, `.readlines().` There are several other modes for using `open()`, and `file` objects have a number of methods besides `.readlines()`, which you know how to explore to your heart's content. \n",
    "* **File pathnames.** Google will help, but this can be tricky. I am running this notebook on Linux, but if you are on a Windows machine, it's *possible* that the code above will give you something called an **`IOError`.** I have a Windows 7 machine, and the code runs okay on it, but Linux and Windows use different separators in their file paths, and this has caused all manner of problems for ages untold. If you have a problem that you can't solve by yourself, please write me at s-f-s-t-r-a-i-n a-t m-e-m-p-h-i-s d-o-t e-d-u (if I have to tell you to remove the dashes, then you are probably a robot, in which case please **don't** write)."

So, let's use an old trick to remove it: yes, the illustrious and magnificent **list comprehension!!!** Also, it's helpful to know about the string object class's **.strip()** method, which removes trailing and leading white space (including newline characters) from strings."

    "\n",

    "* Use a for loop to iterate of the announcements and print each one to the screen\n",

    "* Set up some matches between a group of heroes and their arch-villains\n",
    "* Ask the user if she wants to add any more heroes and villains\n",
    "* If he says yes, take input from the console until she is done and add it appropriately\n",

    "* Announce the matches one by one  \n",
    "\n",
    "And our new design:\n",
    "* Represent the heroes and the villains using strings in a list\n",
    "* Initialize these lists by **inputting from a file**\n",
    "* Take **input from the console** to initialize a loop condition\n",
    "* Conditionally loop over **input from the console** and add input to the lists\n",
    "* Shuffle the list of villains\n",
    "* Use a list comprehension and a format string to generate a list of announcement strings\n",
    "* Use a for loop to iterate of the announcements and print each one to the screen\n",

Also, we'll learn how to output our announcements to a file instead of the screen. And in the not too distant future, we are going to write code to give play-by-play coverage of the battles themselves!! So do come back next week!!\n"
