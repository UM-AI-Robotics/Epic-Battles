    "The important concepts that we introduced here are the following:\n",
    "1. The data structures named `heroes` and `villains` are **`*lists`.** A `list` is defined using square brackets. These particular lists contain **`strings`**, one for each hero or villain. However, Python `lists`, in general, can contain just about anything.\n",
    "2. If you want to know what kind of thing something is, you can call **`type()`**, one of Python's [**built-in functions**](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html). Example: If you enter `type(heroes)` at an IPython prompt, it will tell you that `heroes` is a `list`.\n",
    "3. `Lists` can be indexed. You enter **`heroes[0]`** or **`print heroes[0]`** you will get **`'Doctor Strange'`.**\n",
    "4. The **`for` statement** is a control structure. It has a loop variable (**`i`** in this example) that goes through a set of values (given after the **`in`** [keyword](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/keywords-in-python)).\n",
    "5. The **`range()`** function is another Python **built-in**. If you type `range(4)` and hit enter, you will see that it produces a `list`, `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. \n",
    "6. To summarize this code, the **`for` loop** loops over the values in `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and uses each value as an index into `heroes` and `villains`. As a result, it prints a message for each `hero-villain` match-up.  "

    "This code does the same thing, but it is more pythonic. What does that mean? Short version--more elegant, more compact, and easier to read, almost like reading plain English. Long version? Well, understanding what \"pythonic\" means is part of the journey to Pythonista-hood. If you google \"What does pythonic mean?\" you will get lots of hits. For instance, one blog article about this subject is found [here](http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html). But there are many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second, more pythonic code sample, we introduced several new concepts:\n",
    "1. The **`tuple`**. The simplest tuple is an ordered pair, eg (1, 2). A `tuple` is like a `list`, but it is [**immutable**](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html). It can hold just about anything in general. \n",
    "2. The **`zip()`** function, another Python built-in. It creates a `list` of `tuples` from its arguments (this is called 'packing'). Try creating some `lists` and calling `zip()` on them to see what they return. Or try typing `zip?` at the IPython prompt.\n",
    "3. Tuple **unpacking**. Tuples get easily unpacked when you are ready to use what's in them. You'll see some examples right below this list.\n",
    "4. The **pythonic `for` loop**. Here's where the code gets more pythonic than the previous example. Index variables are often unnecessary, and the pythonic version is much easier to read and understand without them. Well-chosen variable names are also imporant.  When you do need the value of a loop counter, there is a more pythonic way to do it than in the first code example--more on this later. Our new for loop uses **`zip()`** together with **`tuple` unpacking.** This is more pythonic. One of the advantages of pythonic code is that it is more readable (but this is not the only advantage).  \n",

If you want more detailed info, just google \"python sort function\" and/or \"python list sort method\" and you will find tons of links.

But in short, a `list` is one kind of `iterable` object, so we can pass it as the first argument to the `sorted` function. If that's all we do, as we did in the code cells above, the [keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments) listed in the function signature will be set to their default values, which are given after the equals signs. In the examples below, we are going to try giving different values to the keyword arguments, and see what happens. Use trial and error to change these examples, or find new code examples online--one way to do that would just be to add the word 'examples' to the google search above."
